Hello GitHub Viewer!

This was a project I had done in a web design class in high school. This was a partnered project, I worked on the home page and the Jupiter, Venus, Neptune, and Pluto pages.

This project was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am specifically proud of the home page as it took me a while to make the planets move in a circular pattern.
